BackDrop page_background

A simple way to associate an image or a slideshow to a path.

You can upload an image and set it to be shown as background image for the
specified path.
More images on the same path will become a slideshow
(if jquery.cycle is installed) .
You can also associate images to "default" , so if the path you're visiting has
no images directly attached one random image (or a slideshow) from the "default"
is shown.
Backgrounds can also be exposed as a block.
